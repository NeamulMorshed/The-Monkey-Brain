# Changelog — brain plugin

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 1 skeleton)

- Plugin manifest (`brain`, displayName "The Monkey Brain") and repo-root
  marketplace manifest (`monkey-brain`) — the repo doubles as its own
  marketplace.
- Node hook runtime foundation: `hooks/scripts/lib.js` (stdin JSON, `.brain/`
  discovery with graceful degradation, token estimate, hook exit-code
  protocol, self-test). `hooks/hooks.json` registered empty — hooks land in
  Phase 2.
- Placeholders documenting what lands where: `skills/` (Phase 3), `agents/`
  (Phase 3–5.5), `.mcp.json` (Phase 5 qmd).
- MIT licensed: `LICENSE` at the repo root and in `plugin/` (the copy that
  ships with installs), `license` field in both manifests.
