# Changelog — brain plugin

## 0.12.0 — 2026-07-18 (Phase 8: /brain:doctor health monitor)

Fifteen deterministic health checks (MewVault parity), with receipts, and a
report that the next session's status block surfaces on its own.

- **`/brain:doctor`** (`skills/doctor/` + `scripts/doctor.js`) — the mechanical
  scan is injected via `` !`…` `` (zero model tokens), then the skill triages.
  The 15 checks: **1** broken links · **2** orphans · **3** stale/contradiction
  flags · **4** index freshness vs page count · **5** Clippings backlog · **6**
  log gaps (session activity newer than the log) · **7** uncommitted `.brain/` ·
  **8** hook registration · **9** injection size vs budget (reads
  `injection-stats.json`) · **10** semantic-index freshness · **11** WIP limits
  (≤3 active, none idle 21+ days) · **12** instinct-queue overflow · **13** specs
  without a test plan · **14** open **P0** findings · **15** schema version vs
  engine — plus a **model-mix** line from `sessions/agents.md`. Levels
  `ok · info · warn · crit`; **criticals gate `/brain:wrap`**.
- **Health report surfaced next session:** `doctor.js` writes
  `sessions/health.json`; **hook #1 `brain-status`** reads it and injects a compact
  `🩺 Health` line (counts + top findings + staleness) whenever the last run had
  open warnings/criticals — so failures carry into the next session for free.
- **Routing:** `effort: high` (main-model triage); the trigger-router now routes
  "brain doctor / brain health / is the brain healthy / health-check the brain" →
  `/brain:doctor` (and keeps "lint the brain" → `/brain:lint`).
- `--strict` exits nonzero on any warning/critical (CI); `--json` emits the report.
- Selftest 144 → **156 checks** (doctor ×10, router ×2); both manifests validate
  `--strict`.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-07-18 (Phase 7: product & game pipelines)

Two domain pipelines codified on top of the develop lifecycle — research always
filed, plans always with numbered ACs, approval always gating architecture code.

- **`/brain:game`** (`skills/game/`) — the game pipeline: concept → **GDD** →
  prototype spec → build → **playtest** → **balance**. The GDD captures concept /
  MDA / core loop / progression / art direction; its open questions become the
  prototype spec's acceptance criteria (`/brain:plan`, tiered); each playtest is
  **ingested as a raw source** so observations are searchable; each balance
  decision is a `decisions/` ADR. `effort: high`, main model (design judgment).
- **GDD template** `templates/gdd.md` (schema master + bundle, re-synced) —
  `type: gdd`, MDA framework, core-loop framing, mechanics table, progression &
  economy, win/loss, art direction, scope/platform with engine entity links
  (godot / unity / web). Every brain now carries it (distributed by
  `/brain:init --update`).
- **The product pipeline** (idea → PRD → spec → build → track → wrap) needs no new
  skill — it's the standard lifecycle composed with the `product-management` /
  `product-tracking` capability plugins. Documented alongside the game pipeline in
  the instance manual's new **§10 "Domain pipelines"**.
- **Router** routes "start/design/prototype a game", "GDD", "core loop",
  "playtest", "game balance" → `/brain:game`.
- Selftest 137 → **144 checks** (game skill ×3, GDD template ×1, §10 ×1, router
  ×2, routing map now 13 skills); both manifests validate `--strict`.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-07-18 (Phase 6.5: product-design expertise pack)

The first **domain-expertise pack** — packaged process + searchable knowledge
that runs on top of the brain and files every artifact back. Generalizes the
ui-ux-pro-max pattern into a reusable format.

- **`/brain:product-design`** (`skills/product-design/`) — a five-phase
  industry-standard process (discovery → definition → ideation → design →
  validation), each phase filing to the right `.brain/` folder (research →
  `wiki/research/`, personas/journeys → `wiki/syntheses/`, decisions →
  `decisions/`, anti-patterns → `instincts/pending/`). Hands the visual build to
  `ui-ux-pro-max` (design system) + `frontend-design` (build) with the brain's
  accumulated context injected. `effort: high`, main model (judgment).
- **Pack format** (`SKILL.md` + `data/` + `templates/` + `checklist.md`) — the
  reusable shape for later packs (game design, analytics):
  - `data/`: `methods.md` (JTBD, Crazy 8s, SCAMPER, Double Diamond, dot-voting…),
    `heuristics.md` (Nielsen's 10, with severities), `accessibility.md` (WCAG 2.2
    AA under POUR).
  - `templates/`: `persona`, `journey-map`, `hmw` (problem statement + How-Might-We),
    `usability-test-script`.
  - `checklist.md`: the **validation gate** — when a workstream's project-status
    names `pack: product-design`, `/brain:wrap` runs it and **open P0 findings block
    "done"** (Nielsen catastrophes, Level-A a11y failures on core tasks, structural
    design decisions with no ADR) — exactly like security P0s.
- **Wiring:** new `pack:` field on the project-status template (schema master +
  bundle, re-synced); `/brain:wrap` step 1 runs the active pack's checklist gate;
  the trigger-router routes "design a product / create personas / user journey /
  how-might-we / usability test / accessibility audit" → `/brain:product-design`.
- Selftest 127 → **137 checks** (pack structure ×7, router ×2, routing map now 12
  skills); both manifests validate `--strict`.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-18 (Phase 6: bundled-plugin manifest)

Capability plugins do the craft; the brain records the knowledge. `/brain:init`
now offers a curated set, and every plugin's output has a named home in `.brain/`.

- **Recommended-plugins manifest** (`skills/init/recommended-plugins.json`): the
  authoritative set of nine capability plugins — `github`, `frontend-design`,
  `superpowers`, `security-guidance`, `product-tracking-skills`,
  `code-modernization`, `productivity`, `product-management`, and
  `ui-ux-pro-max` — each with its category, what it auto-fires on, a
  brain-integration note, and the exact `.brain/` folder(s) its decisions,
  findings, and artifacts get **filed back into**.
- **`scripts/plugins.js`** renders the offer deterministically (`--verbose` adds
  the integration notes, `--json` dumps the manifest for the future
  `/brain:doctor`) — the same script-does-the-mechanics / skill-does-the-judgment
  split as `lint.js`.
- **`/brain:init` step 6** now offers the set: it lists them, recommends only the
  ones relevant to the project, and installs **model-driven** via `/plugin` after
  confirming the current command with the curator (marketplace names evolve) —
  never silently. Skipped on `--update`.
- **Instance manual §9 "Capability plugins (the craft layer)"** (schema master +
  bundle, re-synced) states the contract — *plugins do the craft; the brain
  records the knowledge* — with the per-plugin filing map and the precedence
  chain (deterministic trigger > domain pack > domain skill > craft plugin >
  general model).
- Selftest 120 → **127 checks** (manifest shape ×4, `plugins.js` ×2, §9 ×1);
  both manifests validate `--strict`.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 5.5: model routing & parallel fan-out)

The right model does each kind of work by default, and routine work can fan out
to Sonnet subagents in parallel.

- **Routing frontmatter across all 11 skills** (`model`/`effort` are honored
  skill fields): judgment & synthesis (`plan`, `review`, `wrap`, `query`,
  `lint`, `compress`) run at `effort: high` on the session's main model — never
  downgraded; routine execution (`ingest`, `research`, `build`) pins
  `model: sonnet` · `effort: medium`; `init` sonnet/low; `terse` haiku/low.
  Hook #7 already enforces the same policy on subagent dispatches.
- **Two Sonnet fan-out subagents** (`agents/`): `brain-researcher` (read-only —
  one focused research slice → cited findings; spawn several in parallel) and
  `brain-librarian` (batch ingest — the 8-step compile in an isolated window,
  respecting raw-sources immutability + append-only log). Each pins
  `model: sonnet`, so hook #7 passes them through while still logging the
  dispatch to `sessions/agents.md`.
- **Fan-out patterns documented** in the skills + READMEs: research fan-out (N
  researchers → main-model synthesis), batch ingest (one librarian per source),
  build+review pair (Sonnet implementer vs main-model auditor), competing
  hypotheses. Spawn concurrently in one message; only summaries return.
- Routing table in `skills/README.md`; agents in `README.md`.
- Selftest 115 → **120 checks** (routing ×2, agents ×3); validates `--strict`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 5: memory & context engineering)

The three memory tiers (wiki · decisions/memory · instincts) become
self-feeding, semantic search is bundled but opt-in, and every injection now
leaves a receipt.

- **Instinct auto-detection** (`instinct-track.js`, PostToolUse): the Gap-#9
  loop mechanized — tallies edits per file across **distinct sessions** in
  `sessions/edit-counts.json`; at 3+ (`MONKEY_BRAIN_INSTINCT_THRESHOLD`) it
  emits a **once-per-file advisory** to file a rule in `instincts/pending/`
  (never a block; bookkeeping files exempt). Scripts notice; the model writes
  the rule.
- **Auto-distillation** (`wrap.js` Stop + `brain-status.js`): after a session
  whose last logged step was `build|review`, the wrap hook blocks **once** if
  no ADR was filed to `decisions/` near that entry — prompting the model to
  distill the "why". `brain-status` gains a **"Decisions (the why)"** section
  so recent ADRs are injected every session; `/brain:wrap`'s definition-of-done
  now includes distilling decisions.
- **Semantic search — opt-in qmd** (`qmd-mcp.js` + `.mcp.json`): a
  `brain-search` MCP wrapper, dormant by default (schema §8: qmd is deferred
  until the wiki outgrows the index ~100 sources). Hands off to real
  `qmd mcp` only when a brain is present **+ opted in** (empty `.qmd` marker or
  `MONKEY_BRAIN_QMD=1`) **+ qmd on PATH**; otherwise a stdlib no-op MCP server
  (valid protocol, zero tools) so no session shows a failed server. `wrap.js`
  SessionEnd runs a detached `qmd update` re-index when opted in;
  `brain-status` surfaces the enabled state or nudges to enable near the
  ceiling. Instance CLAUDE.md §8 documents the steps.
- **Compaction survival** (`snapshot.js`): PreCompact snapshots now also carry
  **active specs and projects** (tier/phase/approval) — the in-flight work most
  costly to lose, not just the next steps.
- **Budget-receipt groundwork** (`brain-status.js`): each injection's size
  (tokens, budget, sections kept/dropped) is appended to
  `sessions/injection-stats.json` (rolling last 20) for the future
  `/brain:doctor` — zero added tokens.
- Selftest 95 → **115 checks** (instinct-track ×7, decisions ×4, qmd-mcp ×5,
  snapshot ×2, receipts ×3); plugin validates `--strict`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 3 complete: develop lifecycle + token discipline)

- **Develop-lifecycle skills** (the v2 schema's verbs):
  - **`/brain:research`** — wiki-first, then codebase, then web; every finding
    cited; filed to `wiki/research/` with a Recommendation; hands off to plan.
  - **`/brain:plan`** — `specs/<feature>.md` with numbered ACs, test plan, and
    tier + rationale; **approval stays curator-owned** (`plan_approved: true`
    only after explicit approval in conversation — never self-set); creates the
    `projects/` workstream page.
  - **`/brain:build`** — red→green→refactor against the ACs in slices; treats
    the TDD gate as the reminder it is; progress ticked in the spec; ADRs
    distilled to `decisions/`; log + commit per milestone.
  - **`/brain:review`** — AC-by-AC verification with evidence (runs the suite
    itself), severity-ordered code review, findings **filed back**: review
    synthesis page, `decisions/` ADRs, 3+-repeat corrections drafted to
    `instincts/pending/` (the Gap-#9 feedback loop starts working); closes the
    spec honestly (`status`/`phase`/`audit_score`).
- **Token-discipline skills** (Caveman-inspired):
  - **`/brain:terse`** — session output-compression mode with the compression
    guard (code, commands, paths, errors, ACs never compressed); `off` to end.
  - **`/brain:compress`** — permanent instruction-file compression (CLAUDE.md,
    memory, rules; never wiki knowledge pages) with before→after byte/token
    receipts and a no-loss verification step.
- **trigger-router** learns the new phrases: "research X", "write/draft a
  spec", "implement the spec", "review the changes", "be terse" (works
  brainless), "compress CLAUDE.md".
- Selftest 88 → **95 checks**.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 4: schema v2 + tier gates)

- **Schema v2 template** (master `schema/brain-template/`, bundle re-synced):
  new record layers `specs/`, `projects/`, `sessions/`, `decisions/`,
  `instincts/{pending,active}/`, `wiki/research/`; new templates `spec`
  (numbered ACs, `tier`, `plan_approved`, `tdd`), `decision` (ADR),
  `project-status`, `instinct`, `research`; log prefixes extended with
  `session | research | plan | build | review`; instance CLAUDE.md rewritten
  at `engine_version: 2.0` (records table, develop lifecycle, tier table).
  Engine master `schema/CLAUDE.md` bumped to v2.0 with the same conventions —
  section numbers kept stable (hooks/skills cite them).
- **Migration:** `new-brain.js --update` and `bootstrap/new-brain.ps1 -Update`
  now ensure every template directory exists and add missing structural files
  (`.gitkeep`, `Clippings/.gitignore`) — seed wiki pages are never added to an
  existing brain, knowledge is never touched.
- **TDD gate** (guards rule 5, schema §4.4): while an active
  feature/architecture-tier spec exists (without `tdd: false`), creating a NEW
  project code file with no test companion is blocked — looks for same-dir
  `<name>.test/.spec`, a sibling `__tests__/`, and root-level
  `test|tests|spec|specs` dirs. Quick tier stays advisory-only. Test-file
  detection strengthened for both gates (`foo.spec.ts`, `test_foo.py`,
  `test.js` now recognized).
- **brain-status:** new "Active projects" section (tier · phase per
  workstream, read from `projects/`).
- Selftest 79 → **88 checks** (TDD gate ×6, projects section, v2 scaffold,
  v1→v2 migration ×2).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 3 core skills + Phase 2 hook set complete)

**Skills — the SDLC verbs land** (`/brain:*`, all auto-activating):

- **`/brain:init`** — self-contained scaffold: bundled `brain-template/` +
  `scripts/new-brain.js` (Node port of `bootstrap/new-brain.ps1`; create /
  `--update` / `--force` / `--sync-template`), because marketplace installs
  ship only `plugin/`. Wires the root `@.brain/CLAUDE.md` import, honors and
  clears `.no-brain`. `schema/brain-template/` remains the canonical master —
  selftest fails when the bundle drifts.
- **`/brain:ingest`** — the 8-step compile checklist (canonicalize → summary →
  5–10+ cross-links → index → log → commit), batch/Clippings modes, gate-aware.
- **`/brain:query`** — index-first retrieval with citations; novel answers
  filed back to `syntheses/` (plain lookups stay lightweight).
- **`/brain:lint`** — `scripts/lint.js` mechanical scan injected via `` !`…` ``
  preprocessing (broken links, orphans, frontmatter gaps, index drift,
  Clippings backlog, strays; `--strict` for CI), then the model's reasoning
  pass (contradictions, staleness, gaps).
- **`/brain:wrap`** — definition-of-done: verify honestly, sync log + index +
  resume narrative, commit with vault conventions.

**Hooks — Phase 2 set complete (8/8):**

- **#2 `trigger-router.js`** (UserPromptSubmit): deterministic natural-phrase
  routing to the skills ("ingest this", "wrap up", "lint the brain", "what
  does the brain know", "set up a brain"). Never blocks; suggests
  `/brain:init` when a brain-needing phrase fires in a brainless project.
- **#5 `snapshot.js`** (PreCompact): deterministic working-state snapshot
  (resume next steps + task-log tail, wiki log heads, backlog) to
  `.brain/sessions/` before compaction.
- **#6 `wrap.js`** (Stop + SessionEnd): once-per-session stop gate when wiki
  pages changed after the last `log.md` entry; SessionEnd self-heals
  `index.md` `source_count`/`page_count`/`updated` from the filesystem.
- **#7 `agent-track.js`** (PreToolUse Agent|Task): every dispatch logged to
  `.brain/sessions/agents.md`; heavy dispatches without an explicit model
  blocked once per session with the routing table (haiku triage · sonnet
  routine · main-model judgment).
- **#1 `brain-status.js`** grew the no-brain fallback: one-line `/brain:init`
  offer on startup in brainless projects; `.no-brain` marker silences forever.

Selftest grows 36 → **79 checks** (router, wrap, snapshot, agent-track,
lint scan, init scaffold, template-sync guard, no-brain offer).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 2, hook #8: resume system)

- **Hook #8a `resume.js`** (SessionStart, matcher `startup|clear`): finds
  `resume.md` (`.brain/resume.md`, falling back to the project root — works in
  brainless projects too) and injects it with a directive to **ask the user
  whether to continue from the notes or start fresh**. Own budget (≤1,200
  tokens): task log trimmed to its tail first, narrative hard-truncated with a
  pointer to the file; the ask-directive is never dropped. Silent when no file
  exists, on resume/compact sources, and on any internal error.
- **Hook #8b `resume-log.js`** (TaskCreated / TaskCompleted / SessionEnd):
  deterministically appends one line per event to `## Task log (auto)` and
  bumps the frontmatter `updated:` stamp — zero model tokens. Inside a brain
  the first event auto-creates `resume.md` from a seed; outside a brain it only
  appends to an existing file (never litters foreign repos).
- `schema/brain-template/resume.md` seeded (with `{{PROJECT}}`/`{{DATE}}`);
  `new-brain.ps1 -Update` now adds `resume.md` to existing brains when missing
  (never overwrites live state).
- Selftest grows to 36 checks (13 new resume cases).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 2, first tranche)

- **Hook #1 `brain-status.js`** (SessionStart): detects `.brain/` and injects a
  budgeted status block (≤3,000 tokens; whole low-priority sections drop first,
  identity/index lines never): operating manual pointer, index stats,
  unprocessed Clippings, active specs + instincts, recent log, memory pointer.
  Silent in projects without a brain.
- **Hook #3 `guards.js`** (PreToolUse on Write|Edit|MultiEdit): secret patterns
  blocked everywhere; `raw-sources/` add-only (edits to existing sources
  blocked); `wiki/log.md` append-only (insertions and `updated:` bumps only);
  architecture-tier plan gate — dormant until `specs/` exists (Phase 4).
- **Hook #4 `wiki-check.js`** (PostToolUse): self-healing wiki — missing
  frontmatter and orphan pages block back into context for same-turn fixes;
  unresolved `[[links]]` are advisory only (deliberate TODO markers stay legal,
  schema §5). Aliases and folder-qualified links resolve; code spans ignored.
- **`selftest.js`**: fixture-based end-to-end suite, 23 checks
  (`node hooks/scripts/selftest.js`).
- `lib.js`: added `readTextSafe`, `parseFrontmatter`, `listFilesRecursive`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-17 (Phase 1 skeleton)

- Plugin manifest (`brain`, displayName "The Monkey Brain") and repo-root
  marketplace manifest (`monkey-brain`) — the repo doubles as its own
  marketplace.
- Node hook runtime foundation: `hooks/scripts/lib.js` (stdin JSON, `.brain/`
  discovery with graceful degradation, token estimate, hook exit-code
  protocol, self-test). `hooks/hooks.json` registered empty — hooks land in
  Phase 2.
- Placeholders documenting what lands where: `skills/` (Phase 3), `agents/`
  (Phase 3–5.5), `.mcp.json` (Phase 5 qmd).
- MIT licensed: `LICENSE` at the repo root and in `plugin/` (the copy that
  ships with installs), `license` field in both manifests.
